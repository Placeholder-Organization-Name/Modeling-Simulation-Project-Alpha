### Examples of Dynamical Systems

A dynamical system determines future states from a model given its current state. There are different simulations regarding these, some examples are:

* N-body model: consists of a dynamical system of particles that interact through physical forces such as gravity.
* Elastic pendulum model: a system which consists of a mass attached to a spring and its future movement behavior is established by its initial conditions.
* Population dynamical system: these are models that evaluate size and age of populations through mathematical interpretations.
* Double pendulum: in a similar fashion to the elastic pendulum mode, it consists of a pendulum attached to another pendulum whose movement will depend on its initial conditions.
* Bouncing ball dynamic model: given an initial throw, this model evaluates the bouncing of the ball according to the conditions of the surface, the ball and its throw.

The main reference from where this was extracted was [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) from Wikipedia. For a further understanding of the examples of these systems, there are more articles and information about them online.
