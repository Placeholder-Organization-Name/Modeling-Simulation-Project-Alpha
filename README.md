### Examples of Dynamical Systems

A dynamical system determines future states from a model given its current state. There are lots of different examples regarding these, some are:

* N-body model: consists of a dynamical system of particles that interact through physical forces such as gravity.
* Elastic pendulum model: a system which consists of a mass attached to a spring and its future movement behavior is established by its initial conditions.
* Population dynamical system: these are models that evaluate size and age of populations through mathematical interpretations.
* Double pendulum: in a similar fashion to the elastic pendulum mode, it consists of a pendulum attached to another pendulum whose movement will depend on its initial conditions.
* Bouncing ball dynamic model: given an initial throw, this model evaluates the bouncing of the ball according to the conditions of the surface, the ball and its throw.

The main reference for this information was extracted from [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system). For a further understanding of the examples of these systems, there are more articles and information about them online.

## Introduction

### The N-body problem

One of the most well-known physics problems in dynamical systems is the **N-body problem**. It consists in predicting the movement of various celestial bodies that are in constant interaction by the laws of Newtonian gravity. The classical physical problem is as follows:

Given the initial orbital properties (current position, speed and time) of a group of celestial bodies; predict all their interactive forces resulting in the prediction of its future orbits.

### Mars

Mars, the fourth planet in the Solar System and second smallest (just after Mercury). It counts with a total of two natural satellites: *Fobos* and *Deimos*.

## Hypothesis 

Given the initial data of a set of celestial bodies (position, speed and mass), it's possible to simulate its orbits. This would be done with the help of the Newton's Gravitational Law and the implementation of the N-body problem. 

## Objective

Simulate the orbits of the natural satellites from a planet in the Solar System. This will be done through the implementation of an  N-body simulation. The main objective will be to represent these orbits with the minimum possible error
